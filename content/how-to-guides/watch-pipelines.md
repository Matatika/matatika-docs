*Time required: **5 minutes***

## Prerequisites
You must have already:

- Signed up for a Matatika account
- Created a workspace
- Created a pipeline

---

## Introduction
Ensuring your pipelines run on schedule and without errors is a business-critical task. Watch your pipelines to be notified in-app and by email when pipelines start, stop, or encounter unexpected errors.

## Watch a pipeline
1. In the app, switch to the workspace `Lab` and select `Pipelines`
1. Click the eye icon on the pipeline you want to watch and select either "Errors" or "All activity"

### Errors
When you watch a pipeline for errors, you will be notified of

- Jobs that have ended with an error
- Jobs that have been skipped

### All activity
When you watch a pipeline for all activity, you will be notified of

- Jobs that have started
- Jobs that have ended (regardless of status)
