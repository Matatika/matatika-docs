Our Meltano data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-capsulecrm` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-capsulecrm` on the [tap-capsulecrm]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-capsulecrm) overview page.

`tap-capsulecrm` is open source, and you can see our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-capsulecrm){:target="_blank"}.
