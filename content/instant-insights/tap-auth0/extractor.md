Our Auth0 data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-auth0` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-auth0` on the [tap-auth0]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-auth0/) overview page.

`tap-auth0` is open source, and you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-auth0){:target="_blank"}.
