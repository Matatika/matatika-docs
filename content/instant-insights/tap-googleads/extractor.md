Our Google Ads data source uses a singer tap we have forked and customised called `tap-googleads` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-googleads` on the [tap-googleads]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-googleads) overview page.

`tap-googleads` is open source, and you can see our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-googleads){:target="_blank"}.
