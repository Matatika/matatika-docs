Our Google Analytics data source uses a singer tap we have forked and customised called `tap-google-analytics` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-google-analytics` on the [tap-google-analytics]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-google-analytics) overview page.

`tap-google-analytics` is open source, and you can see our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-google-analytics){:target="_blank"}.
