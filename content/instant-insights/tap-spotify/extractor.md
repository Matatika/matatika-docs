Our Spotify data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-spotify` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-spotify` on the [tap-spotify]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-spotify) overview page.

`tap-spotify` is open source, and you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-spotify){:target="_blank"}.
