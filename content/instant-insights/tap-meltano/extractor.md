Our Meltano data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-meltano` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-meltano` on the [tap-meltano]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-meltano) overview page.

`tap-meltano` is open source, and you can see our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-meltano){:target="_blank"}.
