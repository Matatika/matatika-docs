Our Trello data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-trello` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-trello` on the [tap-trello]({{site.baseurl}}/instant-insights/tap-trello) overview page.

`tap-trello` is open source, and you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-trello){:target="_blank"}.
