Our Google Sheets data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-google-sheets` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-google-sheets` on the [tap-google-sheets]({{site.baseurl}}/data-sources/tap-google-sheets) overview page.

`tap-google-sheets` is open source, and you can see our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-google-sheets){:target="_blank"}.
