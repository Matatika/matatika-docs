Our weekly road fuel prices data source uses a pre-configured `tap-spreadsheets-anywhere` tap to simplify the loading of data from the Gov UK road fuel prices data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-spreadsheets-anywhere` on the [tap-spreadsheets-anywhere]({{site.baseurl}}/data-sources/tap-spreadsheets-anywhere) overview page.

`tap-spreadsheets-anywhere` is open source, and you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-spreadsheets-anywhere){:target="_blank"}.
