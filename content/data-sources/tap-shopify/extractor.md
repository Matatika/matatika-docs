Our Shopify data source uses a singer tap we created called `tap-shopify` to extract your data. 

You can find documentation about `tap-shopify` on the [tap-shopify]({{site.baseurl}}/data-sources/tap-shopify) overview page.

`tap-shopify` is open source, and you can see the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matatika/tap-shopify){:target="_blank"}.
